WIP - Repo for the Django learning management system I'm building for my capstone project for USIU-A.

### Core Architecture Components

**Microservices approach with these main components:**

- **Web application** (LMS interface)
- **Streaming service** (live video handling)
- **Recording service** (video processing & storage)
- **Real-time communication** (chat, Q&A during streams)
- **Database layer** (user data, courses, recordings)
